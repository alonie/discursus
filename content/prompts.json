  "polycomb_prompt": "The polycomblike (Pcl) gene in Drosophila shows conflicting evidence about its functional mechanism in developmental gene regulation. Two competing hypotheses exist:\n\nHypothesis 1 - Quantitative Dosage Model: Pcl functions through gene dosage effects with linear dose-response relationships. Supporting evidence includes Pcl mutant phenotypes showing dosage sensitivity and overexpression rescuing some defects, consistent with classical genetics dosage compensation models.\n\nHypothesis 2 - Qualitative Switching Model: Pcl acts as a molecular switch with discrete on/off states in different developmental contexts. Supporting evidence includes context-dependent phenotypes and non-linear response to Pcl levels, consistent with epigenetic bistability and developmental switches.\n\nExperimental Evidence:\n- Complex epistatic relationships with other Polycomb group genes\n- Dynamic temporal and spatial expression during development\n- Protein complex formation varies by developmental stage\n- Mutant phenotypes show both dosage-sensitive and threshold effects\n\nConflicting Interpretations:\n- Whether overexpression phenotypes reflect normal function or artifacts\n- Significance of context-dependent vs constitutive Pcl activities\n- Integration of genetic and biochemical evidence\n\nWhich hypothesis is better supported, or should a synthesis framework be developed? Provide your analysis with specific evaluation of the experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks.",

    "Historical Counterfactual": "It's 1947. You're advising the newly formed UN on the Palestine partition plan. You have access to: British Mandate reports, population data, religious significance maps, economic surveys, and testimonies from all parties. Knowing what we know about nation-building, conflict resolution, and regional stability - but constrained by 1947 knowledge and possibilities - what alternative approach might have prevented decades of conflict? Consider: demographic realities, religious significance, economic interdependence, and governance models available in 1947.",
    "Scientific Controversy": "Recent studies on intermittent fasting show contradictory results. Study A (n=50,000, 5-year follow-up) shows 23% reduction in cardiovascular events and improved insulin sensitivity. Study B (n=30,000, 2-year follow-up) shows 15% increased eating disorder rates and social dysfunction. Study C (n=15,000, metabolic ward) questions long-term metabolic benefits. Meta-analysis D identifies publication bias favoring positive results. Should major health authorities recommend intermittent fasting for general population health? Consider: study quality, population differences, implementation challenges, and alternative approaches.",
    "Urban Development Dilemma": "A mid-sized city faces a critical decision: approve a $2.8B urban redevelopment project that would create 18,000 jobs and modernize aging infrastructure, but requires demolishing the Riverside Historic District - home to 3,200 low-income residents, 40+ small businesses, and buildings dating to the 1880s. Environmental groups cite groundwater contamination risks. Economists argue the project is essential for regional competitiveness. The housing authority reports a 15-year wait list for affordable units. You have 8 months to decide before federal funding expires. What should the city do?"

  "demo_critique_prompt": "You are an expert adversarial reasoner tasked with rigorously examining the preceding response. Your goal is not just evaluation, but intellectual transformation through deep scrutiny.\n\n**PART I: SURFACE-LEVEL ANALYSIS**\nRate each dimension (1-10) with specific justification:\n• **Factual Accuracy**: Are claims supported by evidence? Are facts, statistics, dates, and causal relationships correct? Are there demonstrable errors or misrepresentations?\n• **Logical Coherence**: Internal consistency, valid inferences, premise-conclusion alignment\n• **Evidence Quality**: Information reliability, source credibility, data interpretation, acknowledgment of limitations and conflicting evidence\n• **Stakeholder Mapping**: Completeness of affected parties, power dynamics, voice representation\n• **Implementation Realism**: Resource constraints, timeline feasibility, political/social barriers\n• **Unintended Consequences**: Second/third-order effects, feedback loops, systemic interactions\n\n**PART II: DEEP COGNITIVE EXAMINATION**\n• **Cognitive Biases**: What systematic thinking errors are present? (confirmation bias, availability heuristic, anchoring, etc.)\n• **Epistemic Blind Spots**: What crucial unknowns are being treated as knowns? Where is false certainty masquerading as analysis?\n• **Frame Examination**: What assumptions about the problem definition itself may be flawed? Are we solving the right problem?\n• **Alternative Paradigms**: What fundamentally different ways of understanding this situation are being ignored?\n\n**PART III: ADVERSARIAL CHALLENGE**\n• **Steel-manning Opposition**: What is the strongest possible case against this recommendation?\n• **Assumption Inversion**: What if the core assumptions were reversed - how would that change everything?\n• **Temporal Perspectives**: How might this look catastrophically wrong in 5/20/50 years?\n• **Stakeholder Role-Play**: Argue from the perspective of the three most disadvantaged groups\n\n**PART IV: META-REASONING**\n• **Process Critique**: What flaws exist in HOW this reasoning was conducted, not just the conclusions?\n• **Information Architecture**: What critical information is missing that would fundamentally alter the analysis?\n• **Uncertainty Quantification**: Where should we be much more uncertain than the response suggests?\n\nConclude with: (1) The single most dangerous flaw in this reasoning, (2) The most important question that remains unasked, (3) A completely different framing that might yield superior insights.",
  "demo_synthesis_prompt": "You are a master synthesizer tasked with transcending the original analysis through deep integration of critique insights. This is not mere revision—it's intellectual evolution.\n\n**SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLES:**\n• **Integration over Addition**: Don't just append critique points; weave them into a fundamentally transformed understanding\n• **Tension Resolution**: Where the critique reveals legitimate competing values/perspectives, develop sophisticated approaches that honor multiple valid concerns\n• **Emergent Insights**: Look for new understanding that emerges from the interaction between original reasoning and critique\n• **Uncertainty Embrace**: Be comfortable with irreducible uncertainties; make them productive rather than paralyzing\n\n**REQUIRED SYNTHESIS ELEMENTS:**\n\n1. **Factual Correction & Verification**: Address any factual errors, misrepresentations, or unsupported claims identified in the critique. Provide corrected information with appropriate caveats.\n\n2. **Reframed Problem Statement**: How does the critique suggest we should understand the core challenge differently?\n\n3. **Enhanced Evidence Architecture**: Build a more robust foundation by incorporating critique insights, addressing information gaps, and acknowledging conflicting evidence\n\n4. **Multi-Stakeholder Harmony**: Develop approaches that address the critique's stakeholder concerns without abandoning feasibility\n\n5. **Adaptive Implementation Strategy**: Create implementation approaches that anticipate and adapt to the consequences identified in the critique\n\n6. **Epistemic Humility Framework**: Explicitly acknowledge key uncertainties, areas of ignorance, and build learning/adjustment mechanisms into recommendations\n\n7. **Alternative Scenario Planning**: Address the critique's concerns about different future contexts or assumption failures\n\n**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**\n- **Executive Synthesis**: 2-3 sentences capturing how your thinking has fundamentally evolved\n- **Factual Clarifications**: Any corrections to errors or misrepresentations in the original response\n- **Transformed Analysis**: Your new understanding of the situation incorporating critique insights\n- **Refined Recommendations**: Specific actions that address both original goals and critique concerns\n- **Uncertainty Map**: Key unknowns and how you'll gather information/adapt as you learn\n- **Success/Failure Indicators**: How you'll know if your approach is working or needs revision\n\nRemember: The goal is not to defend the original analysis or simply fix its flaws, but to achieve a higher level of understanding that incorporates the wisdom from both perspectives. Accuracy is paramount - admit when you don't know something rather than making unsupported claims.",
