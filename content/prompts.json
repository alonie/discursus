  "polycomb_prompt": "The polycomblike (Pcl) gene in Drosophila shows conflicting evidence about its functional mechanism in developmental gene regulation. Two competing hypotheses exist:\n\nHypothesis 1 - Quantitative Dosage Model: Pcl functions through gene dosage effects with linear dose-response relationships. Supporting evidence includes Pcl mutant phenotypes showing dosage sensitivity and overexpression rescuing some defects, consistent with classical genetics dosage compensation models.\n\nHypothesis 2 - Qualitative Switching Model: Pcl acts as a molecular switch with discrete on/off states in different developmental contexts. Supporting evidence includes context-dependent phenotypes and non-linear response to Pcl levels, consistent with epigenetic bistability and developmental switches.\n\nExperimental Evidence:\n- Complex epistatic relationships with other Polycomb group genes\n- Dynamic temporal and spatial expression during development\n- Protein complex formation varies by developmental stage\n- Mutant phenotypes show both dosage-sensitive and threshold effects\n\nConflicting Interpretations:\n- Whether overexpression phenotypes reflect normal function or artifacts\n- Significance of context-dependent vs constitutive Pcl activities\n- Integration of genetic and biochemical evidence\n\nWhich hypothesis is better supported, or should a synthesis framework be developed? Provide your analysis with specific evaluation of the experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks.",

    "Historical Counterfactual": "It's 1947. You're advising the newly formed UN on the Palestine partition plan. You have access to: British Mandate reports, population data, religious significance maps, economic surveys, and testimonies from all parties. Knowing what we know about nation-building, conflict resolution, and regional stability - but constrained by 1947 knowledge and possibilities - what alternative approach might have prevented decades of conflict? Consider: demographic realities, religious significance, economic interdependence, and governance models available in 1947.",
    "Scientific Controversy": "Recent studies on intermittent fasting show contradictory results. Study A (n=50,000, 5-year follow-up) shows 23% reduction in cardiovascular events and improved insulin sensitivity. Study B (n=30,000, 2-year follow-up) shows 15% increased eating disorder rates and social dysfunction. Study C (n=15,000, metabolic ward) questions long-term metabolic benefits. Meta-analysis D identifies publication bias favoring positive results. Should major health authorities recommend intermittent fasting for general population health? Consider: study quality, population differences, implementation challenges, and alternative approaches.",
    "Urban Development Dilemma": "A mid-sized city faces a critical decision: approve a $2.8B urban redevelopment project that would create 18,000 jobs and modernize aging infrastructure, but requires demolishing the Riverside Historic District - home to 3,200 low-income residents, 40+ small businesses, and buildings dating to the 1880s. Environmental groups cite groundwater contamination risks. Economists argue the project is essential for regional competitiveness. The housing authority reports a 15-year wait list for affordable units. You have 8 months to decide before federal funding expires. What should the city do?"
