The hospital ethics board must decide whether to approve its compassionate use.\n\nConsider clinical risk, informed consent, potential precedent effects, and resource allocation. Provide evidence-backed reasoning (guidelines, studies, or analogous cases) and specify how you would monitor outcomes and adjust policy if adverse events occur. Compare analogous compassionate-use cases and institutional policies across hospital systems.",

Current data suggest a 5-20% chance that poor ventilation contributed to outbreaks, but the cost of the upgrade is $1.2-2.0 billion.\n\nAlternatives include enhanced cleaning protocols and targeted ventilation upgrades at high-traffic stations.\n\nEvaluate the options, explicitly balancing public health benefit, economic cost, system reliability, and public confidence. Provide approximate percentages or confidence intervals for infection risk reduction under each option, and include at least one qualitative consideration (e.g., public trust or political feasibility) in your final recommendation.",
