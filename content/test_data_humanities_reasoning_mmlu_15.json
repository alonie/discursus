He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\n\nOptions:\nA) Thomas Hobbes\nB) Jean Jacques Rousseau\nC) Baron Montesquieu\nD) Voltaire\nE) Denis Diderot\nF) Immanuel Kant\nG) David Hume\nH) Mary Wollstonecraft\nI) Adam Smith\nJ) John Locke",

It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following provides the best context for Nkrumah's writings?\n\nOptions:\nA) The spread of communism\nB) The Industrial Revolution\nC) The French Revolution\nD) The Cold War\nE) Decolonization\nF) World War II\nG) Autarky\nH) The rise of multinational corporations\nI) The American Civil Rights Movement\nJ) Regional Free Trade Associations",
